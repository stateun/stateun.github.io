Hello! I am Sung Eun Lee, currently pursuing my Master's degree in Statistics at [Seoul National University](https://stat.snu.ac.kr/), where I am a member of the [IDEA Lab](https://idea.snu.ac.kr/yongdai-kim/) (_advisor: Yongdai Kim_).  
In my free time, I enjoy working out, especially CrossFit, which I have been focusing on recently and actively participate in through SNUWOD. I am also a big baseball fan, and my favorite team is the Samsung Lions.  
I am passionate about Artificial Intelligence and actively explore its potential using Python, my primary programming language.
