# Transfer Learning and Ensemble Strategies for CUB-200 Classification

- **Deadline** 📅: December 15, 2024, 11:59 PM  
- **Score** 🌟: 30/30  

This homework investigates transfer learning for the **CUB-200 dataset**, where using pre-trained models was prohibited. To explore pre-training effects, we experimented with CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets and also relied solely on the CUB-200 train set. However, pre-training did not significantly improve performance.

## Summary
- **Keywords**: Transfer Learning, ResNet, CIFAR-100, Ensemble, CUB-200
- **Performance**: 
  - ResNet-18 Ensemble: ~36.7% validation accuracy
  - ResNet-34 Ensemble: More stable training but no significant accuracy gain
- **Limitations**:
  - Overfitting due to insufficient dataset compatibility
  - Data augmentation had minimal effect
  - Transfer learning struggled with class mismatch between CIFAR and CUB-200 datasets
