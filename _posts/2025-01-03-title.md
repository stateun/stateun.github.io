# Transfer Learning and Ensemble Strategies for CUB-200 Classification

**Deadline** ðŸ“…: December 15, 2024, 11:59 PM

This project explores transfer learning for the **CUB-200 dataset** without using ImageNet pre-training. Instead, models were pre-trained on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, and ensemble methods were applied to enhance test accuracy. The study highlights the limitations of transferring knowledge between datasets with varying class distributions.

## Summary
- **Keywords**: Transfer Learning, ResNet, CIFAR-100, Ensemble, CUB-200
- **Performance**: 
  - ResNet-18 Ensemble: ~36.7% validation accuracy
  - ResNet-34 Ensemble: More stable training but no significant accuracy gain
- **Limitations**:
  - Overfitting due to insufficient dataset compatibility
  - Data augmentation had minimal effect
  - Transfer learning struggled with class mismatch between CIFAR and CUB-200 datasets
