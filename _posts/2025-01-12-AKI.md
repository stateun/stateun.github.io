## Overview

### 1. Period
**September 11, 2024 – October 23, 2024**

### 2. Topic
**Datathon for AKI Prediction in SNUBH**

### 3. Schedule
**Preliminary Round**  
Participants will develop an Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) prediction model using the **MIMIC-IV** dataset.

- **MIMIC-IV Dataset Description**  
  - Publicly available EHR dataset where patient identifiers have been removed.  
  - **Number of patients**: Approximately 364,627  
  - **Number of admissions**: 546,028 total admissions, including 94,458 ICU admissions  

**Final Round**  
Participants will build a real-world AKI prediction model using the **SNUBH** dataset. Please note that this dataset **must not be shared externally** as per the organizer’s regulations.

### 4. Approaches

1. **Treating AKI-Positive Patients as Anomalies**  
   Since patients who develop AKI are considered a relatively rare group, they will be treated as anomalies.

2. **DeepSAD for Anomaly Detection**  
   We employ the **DeepSAD** approach to detect anomalies in the dataset, leveraging its ability to learn from minority cases effectively.

3. **Fairness Metrics**  
   To ensure fairness in our predictions, we incorporate the following fairness metrics into our loss function $$\mathcal{L}_{\text{Fair}}$$:

   - **Demographic Parity (DP)**  
     The proportion of predicted positives should be similar between the protected group and the non-protected group.

   - **Equalized Odds (EO)**  
     For true positives and true negatives, the predicted positive rates should be similar across different groups.

By integrating these fairness objectives directly into our model training, we aim to build a predictive system that is both accurate and equitable for diverse patient populations.
